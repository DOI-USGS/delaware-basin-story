      <h4>Quality and Quantity</h4>
      <p>Taken alone, managing to make sure there’s <span class="emph">enough water is not enough.</span>  Water needs to be of <span class="emph">good quality,</span> too.</p>
      <p>Water quality affects whether Delaware River water is suitable for drinking, recreation, agriculture, industry, and aquatic life. But it goes the other way too – human activities like reservoir releases, water withdrawals, wastewater discharges, land use and management, and many others affect water quality as well.</p>
      <p>Water quality in the Delaware River Basin has improved greatly since the mid-20th century. It's inspiring water quality history can be explored at the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/drbc/quality/">Delaware River Basin Commission's recap</a>, and raw data can be downloaded from the <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/qw">National Water Information System</a> and <a href="https://www.waterqualitydata.us/">Water Quality Portal.</a></p>
      <p>The USGS monitors lots of water quality measures, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature</li>
        <li>Salinity</li>
        <li>Sediment and turbidity </li>
        <li>Nutrients</li>
        <li>Dissolved oxygen</li>
        <li>Pathogens</li>
        <li>Metals, including mercury </li>
        <li>Chemical contaminants, including PCBs and PFAS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the rest of this story, we’ll dive into two water-quality variables that have drawn recent attention – salinity and temperature – and a new USGS monitoring program that is improving our ability to provide the data needed to manage both the quantity and the quality of water in the Delaware River.</p>

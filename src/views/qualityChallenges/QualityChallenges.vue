      <h3>Quality and Quantity</h3>
      <p>Taken alone, managing to make sure there’s <span class="emph">enough water is not enough.</span>  Water needs to be of <span class="emph">good quality,</span> too.</p>
      <p>Water quality affects whether Delaware River water is suitable for drinking, recreation, agriculture, industry, and aquatic life. But it goes the other way too – human activities like reservoir releases, water withdrawals, wastewater discharges, land use and management, and many others affect water quality as well.</p>
      <p>
        Water quality in the Delaware River Basin has improved greatly since the mid-20th century. Its inspiring water quality history can be explored at the <a

      <p>The USGS and collaborators study a multitude of water-quality factors in the Basin. These include sediment, turbidity, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, pathogens, heavy metals, and chemical contaminants, each with a story of its own.</p>
      <p>In this story, we’ll dive into two water-quality variables that have drawn recent attention – salinity and temperature – and a new USGS monitoring program that is improving our ability to provide the data needed to manage both the quantity and the quality of water in the Delaware River.</p>

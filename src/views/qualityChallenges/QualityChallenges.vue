      <h3>Taken alone, enough water is not enough – it needs to be of sufficient quality, too. </h3>
      <p>Water quality affects the suitability of water for drinking, recreation, agriculture, industry, and aquatic life. Reservoir releases, water withdrawals, wastewater discharges, land use and management, and many other human activities affect many dimensions of water quality: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temperature</li>
        <li>Salinity</li>
        <li>Sediment and turbidity </li>
        <li>Nutrients</li>
        <li>Dissolved oxygen</li>
        <li>Pathogens</li>
        <li>Metals, including mercury </li>
        <li>Chemical contaminants, including PCBs and PFAS </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Water quality in the Basin has improved greatly since the mid-20th century. More information about the Basin’s inspiring water quality history is at the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/drbc/quality/">Delaware River Basin Commission website</a>, and raw data can be downloaded from the <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/qw">National Water Information System</a> and <a href="https://www.waterqualitydata.us/">Water Quality Portal</a>. In the rest of this article, we’ll dive into the causes and effects of two water quality variables that have drawn recent attention – salinity and temperature – and an exciting new USGS monitoring program that is improving our ability to manage both the quantity and the quality of river waters throughout the Basin.  </p>

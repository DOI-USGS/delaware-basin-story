    <p>Water uses in the Delaware Basin are diverse and complicated, and the need for information that describes the present and future conditions of water availability and water quality is more pressing than ever. Monitoring and science help paint a clearer picture of how the DRB has changed, and new efforts are building models that better predict the health and function of the river in the future.  </p>
    <p>While our story focused on flow, temperature, and salinity in the DRB, a multitude of other water quality factors are being studied in the basin by USGS and collaborators, including sediment, turbidity, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, pathogens, heavy metals and chemical contaminants (including PCBs and PFAS). Many important studies...[or close this off in some way speaking to the depth of science in the basin]. </p>
    <p>USGS continues to partner with numerous stakeholders in the Basin and listen to water managers and an increasingly water-aware public in order to refine priorities. As a result, the new advanced monitoring strategy of the Next-Generation Water Observing System is enhancing water data collection, and the modernized publicly available data delivery supports rapid data downloads and interactive views of current conditions [link here to new site pages?]. USGS is also actively researching drivers and controls of water availability and focusing on new methods to forecast future water demands and water supplies.  </p>

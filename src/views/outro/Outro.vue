    <p>What we’ve learned is that things aren’t that bad in the DRB. In fact, things are better than we expected. Specific example 1. Specific example 2. And despite rapid growth in urban development, industrial water use, and population in the DRB since the Supreme Court’s initial mandate in 1954, the USGS has been able to keep up with the need for data to manage water in the DRB.</p>
    <p>Optional tie in to the next phase of monitoring: Looking ahead, the federal government has a slate of 10 other river basins in the country that will receive this kind of monitoring investment. In 2024?, the Upper Colorado River Basin will receive $#,000,000 to install similar monitoring stations, drone operations, and ____. The Upper Colorado will take the USGS science to a new level, since in addition to all the water management challenges in the DRB, it also struggles with _____. Eventually, what we learned in the DRB will serve as a launchpad for water monitoring in every major river basin in the country.</p>

    <p>Water management is very, very complicated. Every change you make here affects something else downstream. To make system-wide management decisions, we need the best data possible and the most complete understanding of water dynamics we can achieve.</p>
    <p>In the last ## years, the USGS has done this and this for the scientific understanding of our nations waterways. And with the future of water management only becoming more complicated with our changing world, we’ll need the very best science on our side.</p>

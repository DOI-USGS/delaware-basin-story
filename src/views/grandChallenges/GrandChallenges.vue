      Everything has an impact on one measure of water quality or another.  
    </p>
    <p>
      When it rains on bare soil, the runoff carries sediment into the river and can create sediment plumes that are harmful to ____.  In the winter, runoff from melting snow can carry road salt into the river, creating a pulse of salinity that travels down the waterway. In the summer, when rainfall in scarce, a front of salty ocean water can push its way up the river closer and closer to drinking water intakes.  During the summer of 1960, the salt front pushed its way up to _____ and almost ____.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the water availability for the whole river basin at stake, itâ€™s incredibly important that the players responsible for the balance of the whole river basin make the smartest decisions they can, as fast as they can.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how has the monitoring and management of such an expansive, interconnected river basin been possible?

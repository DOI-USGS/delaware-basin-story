    <h3>Place holder for Salinity Salt Wedge</h3>
    <p>From the sea – salt wedge. Where the fresh river water meets the ocean, the water mixes and forms a brackish, halfway-salty water area called an estuary that is constantly mixing and fluctuating. Estuaries are super important because ___, and there are lots of very particular ecosystems that have adapted to this strange, always-changing environment. In particular, less-dense fresh water spills out from the river on top of the denser, colder, saltier ocean water, forming a sunken “wedge” of salty ocean water constantly pushing upstream against the flow of the river. </p>
    <p>When river flow slows, the salt wedge pushes​
      higher upstream. If it gets to high upstream, it can corrode industrial infrastructure, hurt ecosystems that can’t survive in brackish water, or even contaminate drinking water supplies. We can push it back towards the ocean by releasing more water from reservoirs. But knowing exactly where it is and how it’s changing is important, so we know just what kind of decision we need to make.​</p>
    <p>To do this, ECOMAPPER!! And other stuff.</p>

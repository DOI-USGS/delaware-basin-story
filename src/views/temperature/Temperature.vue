    <h2>Place holder for Temperature</h2>
    <p>Water temperature is an important thing to keep stable. Certain species of mussels, trout, G, H, and K all historically have lived in reaches of the Delaware River that stay within a certain temperature range. The River Master’s release decisions have to take into account what creatures live in what river reaches, and what temperature they like to live at. If we release too much water at once, the water temperature could drop too far. If we restrict flow too much, we could let the water temperature warm up beyond a stable point. To protect their habitat, we have to have hundreds of measurements of water temperature all around the river basin, and monitor carefully how our individual release decisions affect the water temperature downstream.</p>
    <p>The USGS, in partnership with ### partners in the DRB, has installed ### super-advanced monitoring stations all throughout the basin. They are super stations! Two-way changes! Lots of amazing things, lots of amazing science.</p>
    <p>We are really excited about this because _____. The USGS is doing some of the most advanced monitoring in the country right here in the DRB thanks to these monitoring stations. And we’re doing this other cool thing that provides value to the River Master’s decisions and to the people and ecosystems in the DRB.</p>

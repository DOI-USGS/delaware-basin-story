      In the DRB and many other places, water is a finite resource.  ​
      [ insert something about here recognizing the perils of Tragedy of the Commons style thinking ]
    </p>
    <p>
      The US recognized the challenge of orchestrating all the players in the DRB to use and conserve water fairly.​
      To ensure enough water is available for the people, industries, and ecosystems who depend on it, a Supreme Court decision in 1954 established the position of the Delaware River Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The River Master is responsible for compiling data from USGS water monitoring stations to inform how much water to orchestrate the reservoirs and cities in the DRB to maintain streamflow and conserve the waters throughout the year for the entire river basin. ​
      The River Master takes into account rainfall, runoff, and water use by major users like NYC and NJ, and then decides how much water to store or release in the many reservoirs throughout the basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The River Master monitors each reservoir and downstream river reach carefully.​
      To get a rough target of success, the 1954 decree required the River Master to maintain flow at two important checkpoints along the way. ​
      X at a Montague and Y at Trenton.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      So how does the River Master orchestrate everyone?​
      Let’s imagine a single reservoir.  ​
      Water is always entering the reservoir, so any extra water above the “normal” flow rate downstream is saved for later.​
      (make a joke about how it’s the opposite of a “rainy day fund”????)
    </p>

    <p>In the late summer, when there’s less rain, the River Master can decide to release more stored water in the reservoirs to make sure the Delaware River doesn’t turn into a trickle.</p>
    <img src="@/assets/usesNeedsConflicts/images/lessRain.png">
    <p>
      Each Reservoir has to know what to do to make sure that all their discharge, minus whatever is used up by NYC, NJ, etc, adds up to at least the minimum flow level at the two important checkpoints.​
      It’s a complicated job, not just because each reservoir and tributary has its own unique environmental and societal decisions to make.  It becomes a monumental mathematical (and political?) task to make sure that every person, town, industry, and ecosystem gets all the water they need to be stable and healthy.
    </p>

    <p>
      It becomes even more complicated when the release decisions take into account more than just water quantity.​
      Maintaining minimum flow is one thing… but we have other water quality factors to take into account. ​
      ….dun dun dun, segue into Grand Challenges!

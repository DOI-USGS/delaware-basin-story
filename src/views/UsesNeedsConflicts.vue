      In the DRB and many other places, water is a finite resource.  ​
      [ insert something about here recognizing the perils of Tragedy of the Commons style thinking ]
    </p>
    <p>
      The US recognized the challenge of orchestrating all the players in the DRB to use and conserve water fairly.​
      To ensure enough water is available for the people, industries, and ecosystems who depend on it, a Supreme Court decision in 1954 established the position of the Delaware River Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The River Master is responsible for compiling data from USGS water monitoring stations to inform how much water to orchestrate the reservoirs and cities in the DRB to maintain streamflow and conserve the waters throughout the year for the entire river basin. ​
      The River Master takes into account rainfall, runoff, and water use by major users like NYC and NJ, and then decides how much water to store or release in the many reservoirs throughout the basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The River Master monitors each reservoir and downstream river reach carefully.​
      To get a rough target of success, the 1954 decree required the River Master to maintain flow at two important checkpoints along the way. ​

    <p>- Questions answered:<br> Where is the DRB?​<br> Who/what depends on DRB water? <br> Who is involved in this story?​</p>
    <p>
      Here is the DRB. When rain falls in the DRB, it trickles into streams, those streams combine into rivers, and eventually come together as the Delaware River which flows downstream to the ocean
      models run by the DRB River Master, who uses the data to adjust the flow throughout the whole system so it’s kept in balance.​
      It’s all a complicated dance, and we’ll show you the amazing things it takes to make it happen!
    </p>
    <p>The people and industries that live in the DRB need water, and the riverways and estuary where the river meets the ocean supports important ecosystems that have special species and habitat. In order for humans, society, and ecosystems to all get the water they need, the system needs to stay balanced - no one takes more than they need, and we release what extra we have back into the basin.</p>
    <p>
      To keep this system in balance requires collaborative efforts between state, federal, and local partners. There’s an entire system of reservoirs that store extra rainwater and runoff for when we need it. And the USGS works with lots of local partner organizations to install and maintain monitoring systems in river​
      reaches above and below these reservoirs, and these scientific tools give us constant updates on water quantity and quality at any given point in the river. We take all those remote monitoring tools and feed the data into​
